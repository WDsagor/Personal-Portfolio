            <h3><span>G</span>raphics Design</h3>
            <p>A brand is a relationship between a business or organization and its audience. A brand identity is how the organization communicates its personality, tone and essence, as well as memories, emotions and experiences. Visual identity graphic design is exactly that: the visual elements of brand identity that act as the face of a brand to communicate those intangible qualities through images, shapes and color.</p>

            <h3><span>Web</span> Design & <span>D</span>evelopment</h3>
            <p>Using coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement that design is called front-end development. These languages make it possible for users to interact with buttons, images, text, contact forms, and navigation menus. And theyâ€™re integral to responsive and adaptive design. <br>
            A website needs a back end to store and organize all the data that comes through the front end.
